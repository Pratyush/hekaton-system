Step 5 in initial proving procedure is is incorrect. Reread it and fix it.

Make a diagram for what bigtick does and/or how bigticks are wired together or over bigticks

# memory ops is actually larger than number of ticks, because every pcload is 1 op. Fix this by making bigtick take two adjacent pairs and check both. Now we can support up to 2T mem ops

Make structs encapsulating CPU state, memory transcript state, etc. Structure function parameters and return values better

pcload.val should be a DoubleWord not a Word. There needs to be a way to load DoubleWords from memory. Two solutions: 1) make 2 types of LOAD ops 2) Make program memory separate

FUTURE: Do we actually need two separate running hashes for both memory transcripts? Intuition says yes, but it'd be a nice optimization if not.
